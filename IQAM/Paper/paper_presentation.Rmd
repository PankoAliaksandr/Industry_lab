Factor Investing in the Corporate Bond Market Summary
========================================================
Key findings:

- Factor portfolios constructed
using the equity definitions do generate a premium, however, they do not work
as well as the bond-specific definitions, with the
exception of momentum.

- Size, low-risk, value, and
momentum factor portfolios
generate economically meaning-
ful and statistically significant
alphas in the corporate bond
market.

- Combined multi-factor portfolio benefits from
diversification among the factors:
It has a lower tracking error and
a higher information ratio than
the individual factors.

- Results are robust to transaction costs,
alternative factor definitions,
alternative portfolio construction
settings, and constructing factor
portfolios on a subsample of
liquid bonds.

- By applying factor investing not
only in the equity market but also in the corporate
bond market, investors can increase the alpha of
their multi-asset portfolio by more than 1% a year.

- Bonds with lower risk earn higher risk-adjusted
returns.

Factors Definition
========================================================

There are 5 factors that are used in the research

- Market (equity and bond based)
- Size (equity and bond based)
- Value (equity and bond based)
- Momentum (equity and bond based) 
- Low risk (equity and bond based)
- Term 

Bond based:

- Size: the total public debt (also picks up illiquidity premium) defined as the sum of the market
value weights of all company's bonds in the index in that
month.

- Low Risk:  double sorting is used (rating and maturity).
For IG: 

1.  LONG: Select AAA <-> A- bonds only. SHORT: Select below AA- bonds only
2. From these bonds, for LONG: select the shortest 10%; SHORT: longest 10%
For HJ:

1. LONG: Select BB+ <-> B- bonds only. SHORT: Select below BB- bonds only
2. From these bonds, for LONG: select the shortest 10%; SHORT: longest 10%

Factors Definition
========================================================


- Value: To construct value factor portfolios each month,
we first ran a cross-sectional regression of credit spreads on rating dummies (AAA, AA+, AA, ..., C),
time to maturity, and three-month spread change:

<!-- ![](D:/value.jpg) -->


Then the percentage difference between the actual credit
spread and the fitted (âfairâ) credit spread for each
bond is calculated. Finally, all bonds are ranked on this percentage
difference from high to low and selected the
first (last) 10% of bonds for the top (bottom) value
portfolio.

* Momentum is implemented as the past-six-month return using
a one-month implementation lag. They used the
excess return versus duration-matched Treasuries
for consistency with our return measure for
evaluating factor portfolios. They selected the 10%
of bonds with the highest (lowest) past returns for
the top (bottom) momentum portfolio.

Data
========================================================

- Monthly constituent data (excess returns versus duration-matched Treasuries) of the
Barclays U.S. Corporate Investment Grade Index
and the Barclays U.S. Corporate High Yield Index
over January 1994âJune 2015
- Benchmark: Excess returns for the investment-grade and
high-yield market indexes from Barclays
- The four equity factors were downloaded from the
website of Kenneth French. The term factor is the total return of the Barclays U.S.
Treasury: 7â10 Year Index minus the one-month T-bill rate (from the same website).

Features 
========================================================

- Holding period: 12 months
- Long only portfolio
- No leverage
- 10% (20%) is used for a long-short factor
- multi-factor portfolio is equally weighted.
Bonds in the portfolio are equally (market value) weighted

- High yield and investment grade bonds are separated into 2 asset classes
- 2 types of alpha were calculated: CAPM and Fama-French-Carhart
